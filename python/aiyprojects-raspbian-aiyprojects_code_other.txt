# full list see the documentation:
# http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/config
# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------
# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------
# The short X.Y version
# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------
# If your documentation needs a minimal Sphinx version, state it here.
#
# needs_sphinx = '1.0'
# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
# Enables linking to other libs like gpiozero
# Converts Google-style code comments to RST
# Enables arbitrary link shorthand like 'github'
# Config for the extlinks extension

# The suffix(es) of source filenames.
# You can specify multiple suffix as a list of string:
#
# source_suffix = ['.rst', '.md']
# The master toctree document.
# The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation
# for a list of supported languages.
#
# This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
# Usually you set "language" from the command line for these cases.
# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
# The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

# documentation.

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
# Add our custom stylesheet. By default, Sphinx looks for this in _static/.
# Custom sidebar templates, must be a dictionary that maps document names
# to template names.
#
# The default sidebars (for documents that don't match any pattern) are

# default: ``['localtoc.html', 'relations.html', 'sourcelink.html',
# 'searchbox.html']``.

# TODO(namiller): Add an annotator for images.
# MMALPort has a bug in enable.wrapper, where it always calls
# self._pool.send_buffer(block=False) regardless of the port direction.
# This is in contrast to setup time when it only calls
# self._pool.send_all_buffers(block=False)
# if self._port[0].type == mmal.MMAL_PORT_TYPE_OUTPUT.
# Because of this bug updating an overlay once will log a MMAL_EAGAIN
# error every update. This is safe to ignore as we the user is driving
# the renderer input port with calls to update() that dequeue buffers
# and sends them to the input port (so queue is empty on when
# send_all_buffers(block=False) is called from wrapper).
# As a workaround, monkey patch MMALPortPool.send_buffer and
# silence the "error" if thrown by our overlay instance.
# Only silence MMAL_EAGAIN for our target instance.
# TODO(namiller): Add a font size parameter and load a truetype font.
