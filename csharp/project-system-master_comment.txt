/// <summary>
///     Responsible for coordinating changes and conflicts between evaluation and design-time builds, and pushing those changes
///     onto Roslyn via a <see cref="IWorkspaceProjectContext"/>.
/// </summary>
// This class is not thread-safe, and the assumption is that the caller will make sure that project evaluations and builds (design-time) 
// do not overlap inside the class at the same time.
//
// In the ideal world, we would simply wait for a design-time build to get the command-line arguments that would have been passed
// to Csc/Vbc and push these onto Roslyn. This is exactly what the legacy project system did; when a user added or removed a file
// or changed the project, it performed a blocking wait on the design-time build before returning control to the user. In CPS,
// however, design-time builds are not UI blocking, so control can be returned to the user before Roslyn has been told about the 
// file. This leads to the user observable behavior where the source file for a period of time lives in the "Misc" project and is 
// without "project" IntelliSense. To counteract that, we push changes both in design-time builds *and* during evaluations, which 
// gives the user results a lot faster than if we just pushed during design-time builds only. Evaluations are guaranteed to have 
// occurred before a file is seen by components outside of the project system.
//
// Typically, adds and removes of files found at evaluation time are also found during a design-time build, with the later also 
// including generated files. This forces us to remember what files we've already sent to Roslyn to avoid sending duplicate adds
// or removes of the same file. Due to design-time builds being significantly slower than evaluations, there are also times where 
// many evaluations have occured by the time a design-time build based on a past version of the ConfiguredProject has completed.
// This can lead to conflicts.
//
// A conflict occurs when evaluation or design-time build adds a item that the other removed, or vice versa. 
// 
//  Examples of conflicts include:
//
//   - A user removes a item before a design-time build that contains the addition of that item has finished
//   - A user adds a item before a design-time build that contains the removal of that item has finished
//   - A user adds a item that was previously generated by a target (but stopped generating it)
//   - A user removes a item and in the same version it starts getting generated via a target during design-time build
//
//  Examples of changes that are not conflicts include:
// 
//   - A user adds a item and it appears as an addition in both evaluation and design-time build (the item is always added)
//   - A user removes a item and it appears as a removal in both evaluation and design-time build  (the item is always removed)
//   - A target during design-time build generates an item that did not appear during evaluation (the item is always added)
//   - A target, new since the last design-time build, removes a item that appeared during evaluation (the item is always removed)
//
// TODO: These are also not conflicts, but we're currently handling differently to a normal build, which we should fix:
//
//    - A target from the very first design-time build, removed an item that appeared during evaluation. Currently, the item is "added"
//      but command-line builds do not see the source file. This is because a design-time build IProjectChangeDescription is only a 
//      diff between itself and the previous build, not between itself and evaluation, which means that design-time build diff never 
//      knows that the item was removed, it was just never present.
//
// Algorithm for resolving conflicts is as follows:
//
// 1. Walk every evaluation since the last design-time build, discarding those from conflict resolution that have a version less 
//    than or equal to the current design-time build. 
// 2. Walk every design-time build addition, if there's an associated removal in a later evaluation - we throw away the addition
// 3. Walk every design-time build removal, if there's an associated addition in a later evaluation - we throw away the removal
//
// We don't resolve conflicts between changes items, because the design-time build doesn't produce them due to the way we represent
// command-line arguments as individual item includes, such as <CscCommandLineArguments Include="/reference:Foo.dll"/>, without any 
// metadata.

///     Unlike the old project system, we do zero validation when we get added as a project reference, or when

///     during builds and design-time builds (ResolveProjectReferences). This gives a consistent behavior between

// The steps leading up to and during restore are the following:
//
//      1) Evaluation
//      2) Design-Time build (call CollectPackageReferences, et all)
//      3) Push package references & restore data to NuGet ("Nominate")
//      4) If assets file updated during restore, repeat above
//
// It can take two cycles of above (during first open, or when assets file is out of 
// date) before we have a design-time build that contains all the references that a 
// project depends on, up to and including mscorlib/System.Runtime.
// 
// We want the "IntelliSense" operation progress stage to only be considered completed
// once we've stopped this cycle, which will let Roslyn, designers and other consumers
// disable commands, or give indicators that the project is still loading.
//
// To figure out when we've finished the cycle, we compare the last write time of the 
// assets file during the last evaluation against the timestamp of the file on disk just 
// after restore. If they don't match, we know that we're about to repeat the cycle and 
// we're still incomplete. Once they match in timestamp, we know that the last design-time 
// build ran with the latest assets file and we notify operation progress that we're now
// completed with the results.
// If restore failed, we treat as though it is up-to-date to avoid it forever being stuck out of date.
// If the assets file wasn't included as part of the <AdditionalDesignTimeBuildInput> item,
// consider it up-to-date by return MaxValue, so that it is not forever stuck out-of-date.

// At a high-level, we want to combine all implicitly active configurations (ie the active config of each TFM) restore data
// (via ProjectRestoreUpdate) and combine it into a single IVsProjectRestoreInfo2 instance and publish that. When a change is

/// </summary>
// Need to override CPS's version, which it implements on the project node as IVsDesignTimeAssemblyResolution
// Before CPS's version
// NOTE: Unlike the legacy project system, this implementation does resolve only "framework" assemblies. In .NET Core and other project types, framework assemblies
// are not treated specially - they just come through as normal references from packages. We also do not have a static registration of what assemblies would make up 
// a framework, so we assume that what the project is referencing represents the "framework" of accessible types. This is the same as what the legacy project system
// does under the UWP flavor (when the DTARUseReferencesFromProject MSBuild property is set).
// 
// This implementation will work for .NET Core based projects, but we might run into unexpected behavior when bringing up legacy projects where designers/components
// expect to ask for/use types that are not currently referenced by the project. We should revisit at that time.
//
// Ideally this would sit on a simple wrapper over the top of project subscription service, however, CPS's internal ReferencesHostBridge, which populates VSLangProj.References,
// already does the work to listen to the project subscription for reference adds/removes/changes and makes sure to publish the results in sync with the solution tree.
// We just use its results.
// Note we use the original name, not the parsed name, as they could be different
// NOTE: We mimic the behavior of the legacy project system when in "DTARUseReferencesFromProject" mode, it matches 
// only on version, and only against currently referenced assemblies, nothing more. 
//
// See ResolveAssemblyReference in vs\env\vscore\package\MSBuild\ToolLocationHelperShim.cs
//
// 
// If the caller didn't specify a version, than they only want to match on name
// If the reference is the same or higher than the requested version, then we consider it a match
// We only want resolved assembly references
// Important for ProjectNodeComServices to null out fields to reduce the amount 
// of data we leak when extensions incorrectly holds onto the IVsHierarchy.
