          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

FreeType, a software library to render fonts
============================================================================
The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
FreeType Project.

This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
  o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
    interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

  o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
    full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

  o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
    it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
    somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
    FreeType code. (`credits')

We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
encourage you to use the following text:

 """
  Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
  Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.

Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
actually use.

Project Tango C API Example Projects
===========================================
Copyright 2014 Google Inc.

Project Status
--------------
**The Tango service is deprecated. Google continues AR development with [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar), a platform designed for building augmented reality apps for a broad range of devices.**

Useful Websites
---------------
SDK Download - https://developers.google.com/project-tango/downloads

Developer Website - https://developers.google.com/project-tango/apis/c

Contents
--------

This contains the Project Tango C API examples.

These examples use the Gradle build system and were developed using
Android Studio 2.1.

#### Basic Examples

The **cpp_basic_examples** project includes basic examples showing how
to compile and run an application using C/C++:

 * **hello_area_description** - Use the Area Description
   API to create and manage Area Description Files.
 * **hello_depth_perception** - Use the depth sensor.
 * **hello_motion_tracking** - Use the Motion Tracking API
   to track the position of the Tango device in 3D space.
 * **hello_video** - Render the RGB camera image using OpenGL.

#### Use Case Examples

Other examples in this repository show how to build an application for
different use cases of Tango technology:

 * **cpp_augmented_reality_example** - Achieve an augmented
   reality effect by rendering 3D objects overlaid on the camera image
   such that they appear to stay affixed in space.
 * **cpp_marker_detection_example** - Build an augmented reality appliction
   to detect Alvar markers in real world, and to render 3D objects over the
   markers.
 * **cpp_mesh_builder_example** - Use the depth sensor to
   build a mesh of the surrounding space.
 * **cpp_motion_tracking_example** - Use Tango motion
   tracking to navigate in a virtual 3D world.
 * **cpp_plane_fitting_example** - Build an AR application
   to detect planes in the real world to place objects in them.
 * **cpp_point_cloud_example** - Acquire and render a cloud
   of 3D points using the depth sensor.
 * **cpp_point_to_point_example** - Build a simple point-to-point
   measurement application using augmented reality and the depth
   sensor.
 * **cpp_rgb_depth_sync_example** - Synchronize the depth
   sensor 3D information with the color camera information.
 * **cpp_video_stabilization_experiment** - Stabilize the video by
   smoothing the pose and correcting for gravity.

The **cpp_example_util** project contains some common utility code that
is used for many samples.

Support
-------
As a first step, view our [FAQ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-project-tango?sort=faq&amp;pagesize=50)
page. You can find solutions to most issues there.

If you have general API questions related to Tango, we encourage you to
post your question to our [stack overflow
page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-project-tango).

To learn more about general concepts and other information about the
project, visit [Project Tango Developer website](https://developers.google.com/project-tango/).

Contribution
------------
Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page (including the small
print at the end).

#### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License
Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you
own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of
our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We
also
need to be sure of various other things—for instance, that you'll tell us
if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have
to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member
has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our
codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in
touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help
out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

#### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require
review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

#### The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement
than
the one above: the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License
Agreement.
API example that demonstrates marker detection API.

Please follow the instructions below to run the example:
 1. Build and install the app onto your device.
 2. Print one or a few markers from the attached ar_markers.pdf file. Please
    print the marker on a Letter size paper, without using any zooming or scaling
    factor. Please measure every side of the marker using a ruler to make sure
    it is 14cm.
 3. Place the printed marker(s) on a flat surface, tables or walls.
 4. Run the example app from your device, and point the device camera to the
    printed markers.
 5. You will see 3D models of earth or moon on each of the markers.

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright  <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.

                  FreeType font driver for BDF fonts

                       Francesco Zappa Nardelli
                  <francesco.zappa.nardelli@ens.fr>


Introduction
************

BDF (Bitmap Distribution Format) is a bitmap font format defined by Adobe,
which is intended to be easily understood by both humans and computers.
This code implements a BDF driver for the FreeType library, following the
Adobe Specification V 2.2.  The specification of the BDF font format is
available from Adobe's web site:

  http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/5005.BDF_Spec.pdf

Many good bitmap fonts in bdf format come with XFree86 (www.XFree86.org).
They do not define vertical metrics, because the X Consortium BDF
specification has removed them.


Encodings
*********

The variety of encodings that accompanies bdf fonts appears to encompass the
small set defined in freetype.h.  On the other hand, two properties that
specify encoding and registry are usually defined in bdf fonts.

I decided to make these two properties directly accessible, leaving to the
client application the work of interpreting them.  For instance:


  #include FT_INTERNAL_BDF_TYPES_H

  FT_Face          face;
  BDF_Public_Face  bdfface;


  FT_New_Face( library, ..., &face );

  bdfface = (BDF_Public_Face)face;

  if ( ( bdfface->charset_registry == "ISO10646" ) &&
       ( bdfface->charset_encoding == "1" )        )
    [..]


Thus the driver always exports `ft_encoding_none' as face->charmap.encoding.
FT_Get_Char_Index's behavior is unmodified, that is, it converts the ULong
value given as argument into the corresponding glyph number.

If the two properties are not available, Adobe Standard Encoding should be
assumed.


Anti-Aliased Bitmaps
********************

The driver supports an extension to the BDF format as used in Mark Leisher's
xmbdfed bitmap font editor.  Microsoft's SBIT tool expects bitmap fonts in
that format for adding anti-aliased them to TrueType fonts.  It introduces a
fourth field to the `SIZE' keyword which gives the bpp value (bits per
pixel) of the glyph data in the font.  Possible values are 1 (the default),
2 (four gray levels), 4 (16 gray levels), and 8 (256 gray levels).  The
driver returns either a bitmap with 1 bit per pixel or a pixmap with 8bits
per pixel (using 4, 16, and 256 gray levels, respectively).


Known problems
**************

- A font is entirely loaded into memory.  Obviously, this is not the Right
  Thing(TM).  If you have big fonts I suggest you convert them into PCF
  format (using the bdftopcf utility): the PCF font drive of FreeType can
  perform incremental glyph loading.

When I have some time, I will implement on-demand glyph parsing.

- Except for encodings properties, client applications have no visibility of
  the PCF_Face object.  This means that applications cannot directly access
  font tables and must trust FreeType.

- Currently, glyph names are ignored.

  I plan to give full visibility of the BDF_Face object in an upcoming
  revision of the driver, thus implementing also glyph names.

- As I have never seen a BDF font that defines vertical metrics, vertical
  metrics are (parsed and) discarded.  If you own a BDF font that defines
  vertical metrics, please let me know (I will implement them in 5-10
  minutes).

gxvalid: TrueType GX validator
==============================


1. What is this
---------------

  `gxvalid' is a module to  validate TrueType GX tables: a collection of
  additional tables  in TrueType  font which are  used by  `QuickDraw GX
  Text',  Apple Advanced  Typography  (AAT).  In  addition, gxvalid  can
  validates `kern'  tables which have  been extended for AAT.   Like the
  otvalid  module,   gxvalid  uses  Freetype   2's  validator  framework
  (ftvalid).

  You can link gxvalid with your program; before running your own layout
  engine, gxvalid validates a font  file.  As the result, you can remove
  error-checking code  from the layout  engine.  It is also  possible to
  use  gxvalid  as a  stand-alone  font  validator;  the `ftvalid'  test
  program  included  in the  ft2demo  bundle  calls gxvalid  internally.
  A stand-alone font validator may be useful for font developers.

  This documents documents the following issues.

  - supported TrueType GX tables
  - fundamental validation limitations
  - permissive error handling of broken GX tables
  - `kern' table issue.


2. Supported tables
-------------------

  The following GX tables are currently supported.

    bsln
    feat
    just
    kern(*)
    lcar
    mort
    morx
    opbd
    prop
    trak

  The following GX tables are currently unsupported.

    cvar
    fdsc
    fmtx
    fvar
    gvar
    Zapf

  The following GX tables won't be supported.

    acnt(**)
    hsty(***)

  The following undocumented tables in TrueType fonts designed for Apple
  platform aren't handled either.

    addg
    CVTM
    TPNM
    umif


  *)   The `kern'  validator handles both  the classic and the  new kern
       formats;  the former  is supported  on both  Microsoft  and Apple
       platforms, while the latter is supported on Apple platforms.

  **)  `acnt' tables are not supported by currently available Apple font
       tools.

  ***) There  is  one more  Apple  extension,  `hsty',  but  it  is  for
       Newton-OS, not GX  (Newton-OS is a platform by  Apple, but it can
       use  sfnt- housed bitmap  fonts only).   Therefore, it  should be
       excluded  from  `Apple  platform'  in the  context  of  TrueType.
       gxvalid ignores it as Apple font tools do so.


  We have  checked 183  fonts bundled with  MacOS 9.1, MacOS  9.2, MacOS
  10.0, MacOS X 10.1, MSIE  for MacOS, and AppleWorks 6.0.  In addition,
  we have  checked 67 Dynalab fonts  (designed for MacOS)  and 189 Ricoh
  fonts (designed for Windows and  MacOS dual platforms).  The number of
  fonts including TrueType GX tables are as follows.

    bsln:  76
    feat: 191
    just:  84
    kern:  59
    lcar:   4
    mort: 326
    morx:  19
    opbd:   4
    prop: 114
    trak:  16

  Dynalab  and Ricoh fonts  don't have  GX tables  except of  `feat' and
  `mort'.


3. Fundamental validation limitations
-------------------------------------

  TrueType  GX  provides  layout   information  to  libraries  for  font
  rasterizers  and text layout.   gxvalid can  check whether  the layout
  data in  a font is conformant  to the TrueType GX  format specified by
  Apple.  But gxvalid cannot check  a how QuickDraw GX/AAT renderer uses
  the stored information.

  3-1. Validation of State Machine activity
  -----------------------------------------

    QuickDraw GX/AAT uses a `State Machine' to provide `stateful' layout
    features,  and TrueType GX  stores the  state transition  diagram of
    this `State  Machine' in a  `StateTable' data structure.   While the
    State  Machine receives  a series  of glyph  IDs, the  State Machine
    starts with `start  of text' state, walks around  various states and
    generates various  layout information  to the  renderer, and finally
    reaches the `end of text' state.

    gxvalid can check essential errors like:

      - possibility of state transitions to undefined states
      - existence of glyph  IDs that the State Machine  doesn't know how
        to handle
      - the  State Machine  cannot compute  the layout  information from
        given diagram

    These errors  can be  checked within finite  steps, and  without the
    State Machine itself, because these are `expression' errors of state
    transition diagram.

    There  is no  limitation  about  how long  the  State Machine  walks
    around,  so validation  of  the algorithm  in  the state  transition
    diagram requires infinite  steps, even if we had  a State Machine in
    gxvalid.   Therefore, the  following errors  and problems  cannot be
    checked.

      - existence of states which the State Machine never transits to
      - the  possibility that the  State Machine  never reaches  `end of
        text'
      - the possibility of stack underflow/overflow in the State Machine
        (in  ligature  and  contextual  glyph substitutions,  the  State
        Machine can store 16 glyphs onto its stack)

    In addition, gxvalid doesn't check `temporary glyph IDs' used in the
    chained State Machines  (in `mort' and `morx' tables).   If a layout
    feature  is  implemented by  a  single  State  Machine, a  glyph  ID
    converted by the State Machine is passed to the glyph renderer, thus
    it  should not  point to  an undefined  glyph ID.   But if  a layout
    feature is implemented by  chained State Machines, a component State
    Machine  (if it  is  not the  final  one) is  permitted to  generate
    undefined glyph IDs for temporary use, because it is handled by next
    component State Machine and not  by the glyph renderer.  To validate
    such temporary glyph IDs, gxvalid must stack all undefined glyph IDs
    which  can occur in  the output  of the  previous State  Machine and
    search  them in  the  `ClassTable' structure  of  the current  State
    Machine.  It is too complex to  list all possible glyph IDs from the
    StateTable, especially from a ligature substitution table.

  3-2. Validation of relationship between multiple layout features
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

    gxvalid does  not validate the relationship  between multiple layout
    features at all.

    If  multiple layout  features  are defined  in  TrueType GX  tables,
    possible  interactions,  overrides,  and  conflicts  between  layout
    features are implicitly  given in the font too.   For example, there
    are several predefined spacing control features:

      - Text Spacing          (Proportional/Monospace/Half-width/Normal)
      - Number Spacing        (Monospaced-numbers/Proportional-numbers)
      - Kana Spacing          (Full-width/Proportional)
      - Ideographic Spacing   (Full-width/Proportional)
      - CJK Roman Spacing     (Half-width/Proportional/Default-roman
                               /Full-width-roman/Proportional)

    If all  layout features are  independently managed, we  can activate
    inconsistent  typographic rules  like  `Text Spacing=Monospace'  and
    `Ideographic Spacing=Proportional' at the same time.

    The combinations  of layout features  is managed by a  32bit integer
    (one bit each for selector  setting), so we can define relationships
    between  up  to 32  features,  theoretically.   But  if one  feature
    setting  affects  another   feature  setting,  we  need  typographic
    priority  rules to  validate the  relationship.   Unfortunately, the
    TrueType GX format specification does not give such information even
    for predefined features.


4. Permissive error handling of broken GX tables
------------------------------------------------

  When  Apple's font  rendering system  finds an  inconsistency,  like a
  specification  violation or  an  unspecified value  in  a TrueType  GX
  table, it does not always  return error.  In most cases, the rendering
  engine silently  ignores such wrong  values or even whole  tables.  In
  fact, MacOS is shipped with  fonts including broken GX/AAT tables, but
  no harmful  effects due to  `officially broken' fonts are  observed by
  end-users.

  gxvalid  is designed  to continue  the validation  process as  long as
  possible.  When gxvalid find wrong  values, gxvalid warns it at least,
  and takes  a fallback procedure  if possible.  The  fallback procedure
  depends on the debug level.

  We used the following three tools to investigate Apple's error handling.

    - FontValidator  (for MacOS 8.5 - 9.2)  resource fork font
    - ftxvalidator   (for MacOS X 10.1 -)   dfont or naked-sfnt
    - ftxdumperfuser (for MacOS X 10.1 -)   dfont or naked-sfnt

  However, all tests were done on a PowerPC based Macintosh; at present,
  we have not checked those tools on a m68k-based Macintosh.

  In total, we checked 183 fonts  bundled to MacOS 9.1, MacOS 9.2, MacOS
  10.0, MacOS X  10.1, MSIE for MacOS, and  AppleWorks 6.0.  These fonts
  are distributed  officially, but many broken GX/AAT  tables were found
  by Apple's font tools.  In the following, we list typical violation of
  the GX specification, in fonts officially distributed with those Apple
  systems.

  4-1. broken BinSrchHeader (19/183)
  ----------------------------------

    `BinSrchHeader' is  a header of a  data array for  m68k platforms to
    access memory efficiently.  Although  there are only two independent
    parameters  for real  (`unitSize' and  `nUnits'),  BinSrchHeader has
    three additional parameters which  can be calculated from `unitSize'
    and  `nUnits',  for  fast  setup.   Apple  font  tools  ignore  them
    silently, so gxvalid warns if it finds and inconsistency, and always
    continues  validation.    The  additional  parameters   are  ignored
    regardless of the consistency.

      19  fonts include  such  inconsistencies; all  breaks  are in  the
      BinSrchHeader structure of the `kern' table.

  4-2. too-short LookupTable (5/183)
  ----------------------------------

    LookupTable format 0  is a simple array to get a  value from a given
    GID (glyph  ID); the index of  this array is a  GID too.  Therefore,
    the length  of the array is expected  to be same as  the maximum GID
    value defined  in the `maxp' table,  but there are  some fonts whose
    LookupTable format 0 is too  short to cover all GIDs.  FontValidator
    ignores  this error silently,  ftxvalidator and  ftxdumperfuser both
    warn and continue.  Similar problems are found in format 3 subtables
    of `kern'.  gxvalid  warns always and abort if  the validation level
    is set to FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      5 fonts include too-short kern format 0 subtables.
      1 font includes too-short kern format 3 subtable.

  4-3. broken LookupTable format 2 (1/183)
  ----------------------------------------

    LookupTable  format  2,  subformat  4  covers the  GID  space  by  a
    collection  of  segments which  are  specified  by `firstGlyph'  and
    `lastGlyph'.   Some  fonts  store  `firstGlyph' and  `lastGlyph'  in
    reverse order,  so the segment specification is  broken.  Apple font
    tools ignore this error silently;  a broken segment is ignored as if
    it  did not  exist.   gxvalid  warns and  normalize  the segment  at
    FT_VALIDATE_DEFAULT, or ignore  the segment at FT_VALIDATE_TIGHT, or
    abort at FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      1 font includes broken LookupTable format 2, in the `just' table.

    *) It seems  that all fonts manufactured by  ITC for AppleWorks have
       this error.

  4-4. bad bracketing in glyph property (14/183)
  ----------------------------------------------

    GX/AAT defines a  `bracketing' property of the glyphs  in the `prop'
    table,  to control layout  features of  strings enclosed  inside and
    outside  of   brackets.   Some  fonts   give  inappropriate  bracket
    properties  to glyphs.   Apple  font tools  warn  about this  error;
    gxvalid warns too and aborts at FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      14 fonts include wrong bracket properties.


  4-5. invalid feature number (117/183)
  -------------------------------------

    The GX/AAT extension can  include 255 different layout features, but
    popular      layout      features      are      predefined      (see
    http://developer.apple.com/fonts/Registry/index.html).   Some  fonts
    include feature  numbers which are incompatible  with the predefined
    feature registry.

    In our survey, there are 140 fonts including `feat' table.

    a) 67 fonts use a feature number which should not be used.
    b) 117 fonts set the wrong feature range (nSetting).  This is mostly
       found in the `mort' and `morx' tables.

    Apple  font tools give  no warning,  although they  cannot recognize
    what  the feature  is.   At FT_VALIDATE_DEFAULT,  gxvalid warns  but
    continues in both cases (a, b).  At FT_VALIDATE_TIGHT, gxvalid warns
    and aborts for (a), but continues for (b).  At FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID,
    gxvalid warns and aborts in both cases (a, b).

  4-6. invalid prop version (10/183)
  ----------------------------------

    As most TrueType GX tables, the `prop' table must start with a 32bit
    version identifier: 0x00010000,  0x00020000 or 0x00030000.  But some
    fonts  store nonsense binary  data instead.   When Apple  font tools
    find them, they abort the processing immediately, and the data which
    follows is unhandled.  gxvalid does the same.

      10 fonts include broken `prop' version.

    All  of these  fonts are  classic  TrueType fonts  for the  Japanese
    script, manufactured by Apple.

  4-7. unknown resource name (2/183)
  ------------------------------------

    NOTE: THIS IS NOT A TRUETYPE GX ERROR.

    If  a TrueType  font is  stored  in the  resource fork  or in  dfont
    format, the data must be tagged as `sfnt' in the resource fork index
    to invoke TrueType font handler for the data.  But the TrueType font
    data  in   `Keyboard.dfont'  is  tagged   as  `kbd',  and   that  in
    `LastResort.dfont' is tagged as  `lst'.  Apple font tools can detect
    that the data is in  TrueType format and successfully validate them.
    Maybe  this is possible  because they  are known  to be  dfont.  The
    current  implementation  of the  resource  fork  driver of  FreeType
    cannot do that, thus gxvalid cannot validate them.

      2 fonts use an unknown tag for the TrueType font resource.

5. `kern' table issues
----------------------

  In common terminology of TrueType, `kern' is classified as a basic and
  platform-independent table.  But there are Apple extensions of `kern',
  and  there is  an  extension which  requires  a GX  state machine  for
  contextual kerning.   Therefore, gxvalid includes  a special validator
  for  `kern' tables.   Unfortunately, there  is no  exact  algorithm to
  check Apple's extension, so  gxvalid includes a heuristic algorithm to
  find  the proper validation  routines for  all possible  data formats,
  including    the   data    format   for    Microsoft.     By   calling
  classic_kern_validate() instead of gxv_validate(), you can specify the
  `kern' format  explicitly.  However, current  FreeType2 uses Microsoft
  `kern' format  only, others  are ignored (and  should be handled  in a
  library one level higher than FreeType).

  5-1. History
  ------------

    The original  16bit version of `kern'  was designed by  Apple in the
    pre-GX  era, and  it was  also approved  by  Microsoft.  Afterwards,
    Apple designed a  new 32bit version of the  `kern' table.  According
    to  the documentation, the  difference between  the 16bit  and 32bit
    version is only the size of  variables in the `kern' header.  In the
    following,  we call  the original  16bit version  as  `classic', and
    32bit version as `new'.

  5-2. Versions and dialects which should be differentiated
  ---------------------------------------------------------

    The `kern' table  consists of a table header  and several subtables.
    The version number  which identifies a `classic' or  a `new' version
    is  explicitly   written  in  the   table  header,  but   there  are
    undocumented  differences between  Microsoft's and  Apple's formats.
    It is  called a `dialect' in  the following.  There  are three cases
    which  should  be  handled:   the  new  Apple-dialect,  the  classic
    Apple-dialect,  and the classic  Microsoft-dialect.  An  analysis of
    the formats and the auto detection algorithm of gxvalid is described
    in the following.

    5-2-1. Version detection: classic and new kern
    ----------------------------------------------

      According  to Apple  TrueType  specification, there  are only  two
      differences between the classic and the new:

        - The `kern' table header starts with the version number.
          The classic version starts with 0x0000 (16bit),
          the new version starts with 0x00010000 (32bit).

        - In the  `kern' table header,  the number of  subtables follows
          the version number.
          In the classic version, it is stored as a 16bit value.
          In the new version, it is stored as a 32bit value.

      From Apple font tool's output (DumpKERN is also tested in addition
      to  the  three  Apple  font  tools in  above),  there  is  another
      undocumented difference.  In the  new version, the subtable header
      includes a 16bit variable  named `tupleIndex' which does not exist
      in the classic version.

      The new version  can store all subtable formats (0,  1, 2, and 3),
      but the Apple TrueType specification does not mention the subtable
      formats available in the classic version.

    5-2-2. Available subtable formats in classic version
    ----------------------------------------------------

      Although the  Apple TrueType  specification recommends to  use the
      classic version in  the case if the font is  designed for both the
      Apple and Microsoft platforms,  it does not document the available
      subtable formats in the classic version.

      According  to the Microsoft  TrueType specification,  the subtable
      format  assured for  Windows  and OS/2  support  is only  subtable
      format  0.  The  Microsoft TrueType  specification  also describes
      subtable format  2, but does  not mention which  platforms support
      it.  Aubtable formats 1, 3,  and higher are documented as reserved
      for future use.  Therefore, the classic version can store subtable
      formats 0 and 2, at least.  `ttfdump.exe', a font tool provided by
      Microsoft,  ignores the  subtable format  written in  the subtable
      header, and parses the table as if all subtables are in format 0.

      `kern'  subtable format  1  uses  a StateTable,  so  it cannot  be
      utilized without a GX  State Machine.  Therefore, it is reasonable
      to assume  that format 1 (and  3) were introduced  after Apple had
      introduced GX and moved to the new 32bit version.

    5-2-3. Apple and Microsoft dialects
    -----------------------------------

      The  `kern' subtable  has  a 16bit  `coverage'  field to  describe
      kerning attributes, but bit interpretations by Apple and Microsoft
      are different:  For example, Apple  uses bits 0-7 to  identify the
      subtable, while Microsoft uses bits 8-15.

      In  addition, due  to the  output of  DumpKERN  and FontValidator,
      Apple's bit interpretations of coverage in classic and new version
      are  incompatible also.   In  summary, there  are three  dialects:
      classic Apple  dialect, classic  Microsoft dialect, and  new Apple
      dialect.  The classic Microsoft  dialect and the new Apple dialect
      are documented  by each vendors' TrueType  font specification, but
      the documentation for classic Apple dialect is not available.

      For example,  in the  new Apple dialect,  bit 15 is  documented as
      `set to  1 if  the kerning  is vertical'.  On  the other  hand, in
      classic Microsoft dialect, bit 1 is documented as `set to 1 if the
      kerning  is  horizontal'.   From   the  outputs  of  DumpKERN  and
      FontValidator, classic  Apple dialect recognizes  15 as `set  to 1
      when  the kerning  is horizontal'.   From the  results  of similar
      experiments, classic Apple dialect  seems to be the Endian reverse
      of the classic Microsoft dialect.

      As a  conclusion it must be  noted that no font  tool can identify
      classic Apple dialect or classic Microsoft dialect automatically.

    5-2-4. gxvalid auto dialect detection algorithm
    -----------------------------------------------

      The first 16  bits of the `kern' table are  enough to identify the
      version:

        - if  the first  16  bits are  0x0000,  the `kern'  table is  in
          classic Apple dialect or classic Microsoft dialect
        - if the first 16 bits are  0x0001, and next 16 bits are 0x0000,
          the kern table is in new Apple dialect.

      If the `kern'  table is a classic one,  the 16bit `coverage' field
      is checked next.   Firstly, the coverage bits are  decoded for the
      classic Apple dialect using the following bit masks (this is based
      on DumpKERN output):

        0x8000: 1=horizontal, 0=vertical
        0x4000: not used
        0x2000: 1=cross-stream, 0=normal
        0x1FF0: reserved
        0x000F: subtable format

      If  any  of  reserved  bits  are  set  or  the  subtable  bits  is
      interpreted as format 1 or 3, we take it as `impossible in classic
      Apple dialect' and retry, using the classic Microsoft dialect.

        The most popular coverage in new Apple-dialect:         0x8000,
        The most popular coverage in classic Apple-dialect:     0x0000,
        The most popular coverage in classic Microsoft dialect: 0x0001.

  5-3. Tested fonts
  -----------------

    We checked  59 fonts  bundled with MacOS  and 38 fonts  bundled with
    Windows, where all font include a `kern' table.

      - fonts bundled with MacOS
        * new Apple dialect
          format 0: 18
          format 2:  1
          format 3:  1
        * classic Apple dialect
          format 0: 14
        * classic Microsoft dialect
          format 0: 15

      - fonts bundled with Windows
        * classic Microsoft dialect
          format 0: 38

    It looks strange that classic Microsoft-dialect fonts are bundled to
    MacOS: they come from MSIE for MacOS, except of MarkerFelt.dfont.

                  FreeType font driver for PCF fonts

                       Francesco Zappa Nardelli
                  <francesco.zappa.nardelli@ens.fr>


Introduction
************

PCF (Portable Compiled Format) is a binary bitmap font format, largely used
in X world. This code implements a PCF driver for the FreeType library.
Glyph images are loaded into memory only on demand, thus leading to a small
memory footprint.

Information on the PCF font format can only be worked out from
`pcfread.c', and `pcfwrite.c', to be found, for instance, in the XFree86
(www.xfree86.org) source tree (xc/lib/font/bitmap/).

Many good bitmap fonts in bdf format come with XFree86: they can be
compiled into the pcf format using the `bdftopcf' utility.


Supported hardware
******************

The driver has been tested on linux/x86 and sunos5.5/sparc.  In both
cases the compiler was gcc.  When back in Paris, I will test it also
on linux/alpha.


Encodings
*********

The variety of encodings that accompanies pcf fonts appears to encompass the
small set defined in freetype.h.  On the other hand, each pcf font defines
two properties that specify encoding and registry.

I decided to make these two properties directly accessible, leaving to the
client application the work of interpreting them.  For instance:

  #include "pcftypes.h"  /* include/freetype/internal/pcftypes.h */

  FT_Face     face;
  PCF_Public_Face  pcfface;

  FT_New_Face( library,..., &face );

  pcfface = (PCF_Public_Face)face;

  if ((pcfface->charset_registry == "ISO10646") &&
        (pcfface->charset_encoding) == "1")) [..]

Thus the driver always export `ft_encoding_none' as
face->charmap.encoding.  FT_Get_Char_Index() behavior is unmodified, that
is, it converts the ULong value given as argument into the corresponding
glyph number.


Known problems
**************

- dealing explicitly with encodings breaks the uniformity of freetype2
  api.

- except for encodings properties, client applications have no
  visibility of the PCF_Face object.  This means that applications
  cannot directly access font tables and are obliged to trust
  FreeType.

- currently, glyph names and ink_metrics are ignored.

I plan to give full visibility of the PCF_Face object in the next
release of the driver, thus implementing also glyph names and
ink_metrics.

- height is defined as (ascent - descent).  Is this correct?

- if unable to read size information from the font, PCF_Init_Face
  sets available_size->width and available_size->height to 12.

- too many english grammar errors in the readme file :-(

Keith Packard wrote the pcf driver found in XFree86.  His work is at
the same time the specification and the sample implementation of the
PCF format.  Undoubtedly, this driver is inspired from his work.
ftrandom
--------

This program expects a set of directories containing good fonts, and a set
of extensions of fonts to be tested.  It will randomly pick a font, copy it,
introduce and error and then test it.

The FreeType tests are quite basic:

  For each erroneous font it
    forks off a new tester;
    initializes the library;
    opens each font in the file;
    loads each glyph;
      (optionally reviewing the contours of the glyph)
      (optionally rasterizing)
    closes the face.

If the tester exits with a signal, or takes longer than 20 seconds then
ftrandom saves the erroneous font and continues.  If the tester exits
normally or with an error, then the superstructure removes the test font and
continues.

Arguments are:

  --all                    Test every font in the directory(ies) no matter
                           what its extension (some CID-keyed fonts have no
                           extension).
  --check-outlines         Call FT_Outline_Decompose on each glyph.
  --dir <dir>              Append <dir> to the list of directories to search
                           for good fonts.
  --error-count <cnt>      Introduce <cnt> single-byte errors into the
                           erroneous fonts.
  --error-fraction <frac>  Multiply the file size of the font by <frac> and
                           introduce that many errors into the erroneous
                           font file.
  --ext <ext>              Add <ext> to the set of font types tested.  Known
                           extensions are `ttf', `otf', `ttc', `cid', `pfb',
                           `pfa', `bdf', `pcf', `pfr', `fon', `otb', and
                           `cff'.
  --help                   Print out this list of options.
  --nohints                Specify FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING when loading glyphs.
  --rasterize              Call FT_Render_Glyph as well as loading it.
  --result <dir>           This is the directory in which test files are
                           placed.
  --test <file>            Run a single test on a pre-generated testcase. 
                           Done in the current process so it can be debugged
                           more easily.

README for libpng version 1.6.15 - November 20, 2014 (shared library 16.0)
See the note about version numbers near the top of png.h

See INSTALL for instructions on how to install libpng.

Libpng comes in several distribution formats.  Get libpng-*.tar.gz or
libpng-*.tar.xz or if you want UNIX-style line endings in the text files,
or lpng*.7z or lpng*.zip if you want DOS-style line endings.

Version 0.89 was the first official release of libpng.  Don't let the
fact that it's the first release fool you.  The libpng library has been in
extensive use and testing since mid-1995.  By late 1997 it had
finally gotten to the stage where there hadn't been significant
changes to the API in some time, and people have a bad feeling about
libraries with versions < 1.0.  Version 1.0.0 was released in
March 1998.

****
Note that some of the changes to the png_info structure render this
version of the library binary incompatible with libpng-0.89 or
earlier versions if you are using a shared library.  The type of the
"filler" parameter for png_set_filler() has changed from png_byte to
png_uint_32, which will affect shared-library applications that use
this function.

To avoid problems with changes to the internals of png info_struct,
new APIs have been made available in 0.95 to avoid direct application
access to info_ptr.  These functions are the png_set_<chunk> and
png_get_<chunk> functions.  These functions should be used when
accessing/storing the info_struct data, rather than manipulating it
directly, to avoid such problems in the future.

It is important to note that the APIs did not make current programs
that access the info struct directly incompatible with the new
library, through libpng-1.2.x.  In libpng-1.4.x, which was meant to
be a transitional release, members of the png_struct and the
info_struct can still be accessed, but the compiler will issue a
warning about deprecated usage.  Since libpng-1.5.0, direct access
to these structs is not allowed, and the definitions of the structs
reside in private pngstruct.h and pnginfo.h header files that are not
accessible to applications.  It is strongly suggested that new
programs use the new APIs (as shown in example.c and pngtest.c), and
older programs be converted to the new format, to facilitate upgrades
in the future.
****

Additions since 0.90 include the ability to compile libpng as a
Windows DLL, and new APIs for accessing data in the info struct.
Experimental functions include the ability to set weighting and cost
factors for row filter selection, direct reads of integers from buffers
on big-endian processors that support misaligned data access, faster
methods of doing alpha composition, and more accurate 16->8 bit color
conversion.

The additions since 0.89 include the ability to read from a PNG stream
which has had some (or all) of the signature bytes read by the calling
application.  This also allows the reading of embedded PNG streams that
do not have the PNG file signature.  As well, it is now possible to set
the library action on the detection of chunk CRC errors.  It is possible
to set different actions based on whether the CRC error occurred in a
critical or an ancillary chunk.

The changes made to the library, and bugs fixed are based on discussions
on the PNG-implement mailing list and not on material submitted
privately to Guy, Andreas, or Glenn.  They will forward any good
suggestions to the list.

For a detailed description on using libpng, read libpng-manual.txt.  For
examples of libpng in a program, see example.c and pngtest.c.  For usage
information and restrictions (what little they are) on libpng, see
png.h.  For a description on using zlib (the compression library used by
libpng) and zlib's restrictions, see zlib.h

I have included a general makefile, as well as several machine and
compiler specific ones, but you may have to modify one for your own needs.

You should use zlib 1.0.4 or later to run this, but it MAY work with
versions as old as zlib 0.95.  Even so, there are bugs in older zlib
versions which can cause the output of invalid compression streams for
some images.  You will definitely need zlib 1.0.4 or later if you are
taking advantage of the MS-DOS "far" structure allocation for the small
and medium memory models.  You should also note that zlib is a
compression library that is useful for more things than just PNG files.
You can use zlib as a drop-in replacement for fread() and fwrite() if
you are so inclined.

zlib should be available at the same place that libpng is, or at zlib.net.

You may also want a copy of the PNG specification.  It is available
as an RFC, a W3C Recommendation, and an ISO/IEC Standard.  You can find
these at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/documents/

This code is currently being archived at libpng.sf.net in the
[DOWNLOAD] area, and at ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org.  If you can't find it
in any of those places, e-mail me, and I'll help you find it.

I am not a lawyer, but I believe that the Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because it
is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain any
encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 734.7(b).

If you have any code changes, requests, problems, etc., please e-mail
them to me.  Also, I'd appreciate any make files or project files,
and any modifications you needed to make to get libpng to compile,
along with a #define variable to tell what compiler/system you are on.
If you needed to add transformations to libpng, or wish libpng would
provide the image in a different way, drop me a note (and code, if
possible), so I can consider supporting the transformation.
Finally, if you get any warning messages when compiling libpng
(note: not zlib), and they are easy to fix, I'd appreciate the
fix.  Please mention "libpng" somewhere in the subject line.  Thanks.

This release was created and will be supported by myself (of course
based in a large way on Guy's and Andreas' earlier work), and the PNG
development group.
