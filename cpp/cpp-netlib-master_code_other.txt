# This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its containing dir.
#
# Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this
# autogenerated file.
#
# All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out
# serve to show the default.
# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
# Use breathe for doxygen integration
# -- General configuration -----------------------------------------------------
# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be extensions
# coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom ones.
# Tell breathe about the doxygen project.
# Default breathe project
# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
# templates_path = ['_templates']
# The suffix of source filenames.
# The encoding of source files.
# The master toctree document.
# General information about the project.
# The version info for the project you're documenting, acts as replacement for
# |version| and |release|, also used in various other places throughout the
# built documents.
#
# The short X.Y version.
# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
# The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation
# for a list of supported languages.
#language = None
# There are two options for replacing |today|: either, you set today to some
# non-false value, then it is used:
#today = ''
# Else, today_fmt is used as the format for a strftime call.
# List of documents that shouldn't be included in the build.
# List of directories, relative to source directory, that shouldn't be searched
# for source files.
# If true, '()' will be appended to :func: etc. cross-reference text.
# add_function_parentheses = True
# If true, the current module name will be prepended to all description
# unit titles (such as .. function::).
# If true, sectionauthor and moduleauthor directives will be shown in the
# output. They are ignored by default.
# show_authors = False
# The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.
# pygments_style = 'sphinx'
# A list of ignored prefixes for module index sorting.

# -- Options for HTML output ---------------------------------------------------
# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  Major themes that come with
# Sphinx are currently 'default' and 'sphinxdoc'.
# The name for this set of Sphinx documents.  If None, it defaults to
# "<project> v<release> documentation".
# A shorter title for the navigation bar.  Default is the same as html_title.
# html_short_title = 'cpp-netlib'
# Use an HTML index.
# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,

# html_translator_class = "adjusts.CppNetlibHTMLTranslator"
# If not '', a 'Last updated on:' timestamp is inserted at every page bottom,
